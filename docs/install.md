# Installation

## Prerequisites

* Linux Box
* Python â‰¥ 3.6

#### Provision a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment (conda)

```
conda create --name ampligraph python=3.6
source activate ampligraph
```

#### Install TensorFlow

AmpliGraph is built on TensorFlow 1.x.
Install from pip or conda:

**CPU-only**

```
pip install tensorflow==1.12.0

or 

conda install tensorflow=1.12.0
```

**GPU support**

```
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.12.0

or 

conda install tensorflow-gpu=1.12.0
```


## Install AmpliGraph


Install the latest stable release from pip:

```
pip install ampligraph
```

If instead you want the most recent development version, you can clone the repository
and install from source (your local working copy will be on the latest commit on the `develop` branch).
The code snippet below will install the library in editable mode (`-e`):

```
git clone https://github.com/Accenture/AmpliGraph.git
cd AmpliGraph
pip install -e .
```


## Download the Datasets


Datasets can be downloaded manually or will be automatically downloaded as they are needed.


**It is recommended you set the following environment variable:**

```
export AMPLIGRAPH_DATA_HOME=/YOUR/PATH/TO/datasets
```

When attempting to load a dataset the module will first check if the **AMPLIGRAPH\_DATA\_HOME** environment variable is set.
If it is it will search this location for the required dataset.
If the dataset is not found it will be downloaded and placed in this directory.

If **AMPLIGRAPH\_DATA\_HOME** has not been set the databases will be saved in the following directory:

```
~/ampligraph_databases
```

Additionally a specific directory can be passed to the dataset loader via the **data\_home** parameter.

Datasets can also be installed manually.
The datasets can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16GBu89NCVyyYetry91tMntzpV_mSQ-gK?usp=sharing).

Once downloaded, decompress the archives.

## Sanity Check

```python
>> import ampligraph
>> ampligraph.__version__
'1.0-dev'
```

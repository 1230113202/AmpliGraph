# Installation

## Prerequisites

* Linux Box
* Python â‰¥ 3.6

#### Provision a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment (conda)

```
conda create --name ampligraph python=3.6
source activate ampligraph
```

#### Install TensorFlow

AmpliGraph is built on TensorFlow 1.x.
Install from pip or conda:

**CPU-only**

```
pip install tensorflow==1.12.0

or 

conda install tensorflow=1.12.0
```

**GPU support**

```
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.12.0

or 

conda install tensorflow-gpu=1.12.0
```


## Install AmpliGraph


Install the latest stable release from pip:

```
pip install ampligraph
```

If instead you want the most recent development version, you can clone the repository
and install from source (your local working copy will be on the latest commit on the `develop` branch).
The code snippet below will install the library in editable mode (`-e`):

```
git clone https://github.com/Accenture/AmpliGraph.git
cd AmpliGraph
pip install -e .
```


## Download the Datasets

Datasets can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16GBu89NCVyyYetry91tMntzpV_mSQ-gK?usp=sharing).

Once downloaded, decompress the archives.

**You must also set the following environment variable:**

```
export AMPLIGRAPH_DATA_HOME=/YOUR/PATH/TO/datasets
```


## Sanity Check

```python
>> import ampligraph
>> ampligraph.__version__
'1.0-dev'
```
